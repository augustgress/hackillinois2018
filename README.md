Find friends by matching with individuals with a similar taste of photography as you!
  * Simply upload any pictures to your profile
  * Any pictures that are uploaded with people or faces in them will not be available for other users to see
  * Used Azure Computer Vision API to tag images, and based on confidence intervals, creates weighted documents which are then vectorized using tf-idf and then compared using cosine similarity and other specified user preferences (e.g, orientation, age)
  * We want users to connect based of similar interest displayed through their photos. After connecting, they will be given the option to allow the other user to see their private section of their account, which may include actual pictures of themselves.
